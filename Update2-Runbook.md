# Comprehensive Documentation for Update 2_Ver3 Notebook

This documentation provides a full guide to the notebook’s code, explaining each step from loading libraries to model evaluation and calibration.

---

## 1. Import Libraries

**Purpose**: This block imports libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`, `numpy`), visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`), and machine learning (`sklearn`, `imblearn`). It also suppresses warnings to keep the output clean.

### Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import os
from sys import platform
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, recall_score, precision_score, roc_auc_score, roc_curve, f1_score
from sklearn.calibration import calibration_curve
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, LogisticRegressionCV, Ridge, Lasso
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from imblearn.under_sampling import TomekLinks
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

## 2. Load Data

**Purpose**: Load the dataset and check its structure.

### Code:
```python
df = pd.read_csv("Telco_customer_churn.csv")
df.head()
```

- **`pd.read_csv()`**: Loads data from a CSV file.
- **`df.head()`**: Displays the first few rows of the dataset to ensure it loaded correctly.

---

## 3. Pre-processing

### Inspect Column Types

**Purpose**: Display information about each column, including the data type and non-null counts, to identify potential data cleaning needs.

### Code:
```python
df.info()
```

- **`df.info()`**: Provides a summary of the dataframe, which helps in identifying columns with missing values and checking data types.

### Convert to Numeric

**Purpose**: Converts the `Total Charges` column to numeric, handling any non-numeric values by converting them to `NaN`.

### Code:
```python
df['Total Charges'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Total Charges'], errors='coerce')
```

- **`pd.to_numeric()`**: Converts column to a numeric dtype. `errors='coerce'` turns non-numeric values into `NaN`.

### Drop Columns

**Purpose**: Remove columns that are not useful for the analysis.

### Code:
```python
df.drop(columns=['UnneededColumn1', 'UnneededColumn2'], inplace=True)
```

- **`df.drop()`**: Drops specified columns from the dataframe, which can streamline model training by removing redundant features.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Purpose**: Generate visualizations to understand the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships.

*Examples of analysis here may include histograms, box plots, and pair plots using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.*

---

## 5. Feature Engineering

### Scaling

**Purpose**: Standardize numeric features to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which helps models like logistic regression perform better by ensuring all features are on the same scale.

### Code:
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df[['NumericFeature1', 'NumericFeature2']])
```

- **`StandardScaler()`**: Centers features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

### Handling Class Imbalance

**Purpose**: Use SMOTE to oversample the minority class, balancing the dataset for improved model performance on imbalanced classes.

### Code:
```python
smote = SMOTE()
X_res, y_res = smote.fit_resample(df_scaled, df['Target'])
```

- **`SMOTE()`**: Generates synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the dataset.

---

## 6. Model Training

### Logistic Regression

**Purpose**: Train a logistic regression model with cross-validation to predict binary outcomes. Logistic regression works well for classification by modeling the probability of belonging to a particular class.

### Code:
```python
model = LogisticRegressionCV(cv=5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

- **`LogisticRegressionCV(cv=5)`**: Logistic regression with 5-fold cross-validation for automatic hyperparameter tuning.
- **`model.fit()`**: Trains the model on the provided dataset.

### Regularization Models (Ridge, Lasso)

**Purpose**: Use Ridge and Lasso regression for feature selection and regularization to reduce overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.

### Code:
```python
ridge = Ridge()
lasso = Lasso()
ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)
lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

- **`Ridge()`**: Regularized linear model penalizing large weights, useful in collinear data.
- **`Lasso()`**: Similar to Ridge but also performs feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero.

---

## 7. Model Evaluation

**Purpose**: Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to understand how well it classifies the target variable.

### Code:
```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("AUC-ROC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

- **`accuracy_score`**: Proportion of correctly classified samples.
- **`roc_auc_score`**: Measures the area under the ROC curve, which indicates the model’s ability to distinguish between classes.

### Example Output:
```
Accuracy: 0.80
AUC-ROC: 0.82
```

---

## 8. Calibration and Analysis

**Purpose**: Calibrate model predictions, which adjusts predicted probabilities to be more representative of true class likelihoods.

### Code:
```python
prob_true, prob_pred = calibration_curve(y_test, model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1], n_bins=10)
plt.plot(prob_pred, prob_true)
plt.title('Calibration curve')
plt.xlabel('Predicted probability')
plt.ylabel('True probability')
plt.show()
```

- **`calibration_curve()`**: Plots the relationship between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes to assess calibration.
- **`plt.plot()`**: Visualizes the calibration curve, which shows how well predicted probabilities match true outcomes.
